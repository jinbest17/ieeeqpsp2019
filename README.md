PIR SENSOR:
正面球状：拓宽视野
5个一排从左至右除去电源：h/i model control, sensitivity control, offtime control
3个一排：中间的三个pin：gnd, dout, vcc
3.3v/5v
插下面俩 In “H” mode the output pin Dout will go high (3.3V) when a person is detected within range and goes low after a particular time (time is set by potentiometer). In this mode the output pin will go high irrespective of whether the person is still present inside the range or has left the area. We are using our module in “H” mode in our project.
上面俩 In “I” mode the output pin Dout will go high (3.3V) when  a person is detected within range and will stay high as long as he/she stays within the limit of the Sensors range. Once the person has left the area the pin will go low after the particular time which can be set using the potentiometer.
